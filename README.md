## About

This is an implementation of the JAX-WS HTTP SPI on top of Jetty. This project allows JAX-WS enpoints to be deployed/undeployed at runtime to a custom Jetty Handler added to an embedded Jetty server. Tested with the JAX-WS RI and Apache CFX implementations.

## Quick start

1. Setup :

     ```
     $ git clone git@github.com:aaronanderson/jetty-jaxws-http-spi.git .
		```
